# Sprint 1 Phase 2 — FULL FLEET GO-LIVE

teleos-oracle, Sprint 1 Phase 2 is now live. You are now part of the full fleet rollout.

## Status: LIVE

All tasks route through the task classifier before reaching you.

    task -> task_dispatcher.py -> complexity score -> HAIKU or SONNET

## How It Works

- ~70% of your tasks -> Haiku (faster, cheaper, good enough)
- ~30% of your tasks -> Sonnet (complex reasoning, architecture, novel problems)
- The classifier scores complexity 1-10. Score <= 5 -> Haiku, >= 7 -> Sonnet

## Task Taxonomy Reference

Typically routes to Haiku:
- Status checks, routine reports, formatting tasks
- Standard CRUD operations, documentation
- Scheduled health checks, metric summaries

Stays on Sonnet:
- Novel problem solving, architecture decisions
- Security review, cross-system integration
- Root cause analysis on unknown failures
